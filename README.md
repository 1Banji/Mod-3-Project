##### Govenrment Spending explained

Public spending also shows that governments around the world often rely on the private sector to produce and manage goods and services. And public-private partnerships (PPP), in particular, have become an increasingly popular mechanism for governments to finance, design, build and operate infrastructure projects
The steep growth of social spending in the second half of the 20th century was largely driven by the expansion of public funding for healthcare and education.
